## About
I am a doctoral student in Social Work at the University of Minnesota - Twin Cities ([Link](https://www.cehd.umn.edu/ssw/graduate/current-phd-students/)). My research interests primarily lie in the areas of behavioral health, particularly stigma reduction and resilience building in social work settings and within public health establishments in relation to HIV/AIDS. 

Before I Joined the U of M, I had worked for several child development and humanitarian agencies in S.Korea alongside Rwanda (2016-2018), South Sudan (2012-2013), and the United Kingdom (2011-2012). ChildFund Korea was my previous employer, and I served as a research project manager, program coordinator, and country director (Rwanda).
